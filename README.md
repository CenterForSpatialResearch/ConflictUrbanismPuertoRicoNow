# ConflictUrbanismPuertoRicoNow
Class resources for Spring 2019 seminar Conflict Urbanism: Puerto Rico Now

The following tutorials are designed to introduce students to techniques of spatial research and critical cartographic practices. Through a combination of in class instruction and tutorial exercises completed at home students will develop basic fluencies with open source mapping tools. With support from module instructors, students will apply these newly acquired skills to topics and questions of interest through their final projects for the seminar.

**All students must attend the Final Project Publishing session (March 8), and must complete at least three of the remaining six modules.** See below for descriptions of each. All modules are designed for students with no prior experience with the topics covered. Students will be evaluated on their completion of the required exercises.

Please note: students who have prior experience with GIS or webmaps are encouraged to use this requirement to develop aspects of their final project and should speak with the course instructors about equivalent deliverables.

**[1. Introduction to QGIS](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/ConflictUrbanismPuertoRicoNow/blob/master/01_IntroToQGIS.md)**  
February 1, 11am-1pm  
Exercise due February 8  
This module will allow students to: develop basic familiarity with QGIS and its functions; gain fluency with foundational GIS concepts; understand GIS spatial data types and the kinds of analysis that are possible with each.

**[2. Making Spatial Data](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/ConflictUrbanismPuertoRicoNow/blob/master/02_MakingSpatialData.md)**
February 8, 11am-1pm  
Exercise due February 15  
This module will introduce students to methods for creating spatial data. The exercise and workshop will cover how to give geographic coordinates (georeference) scanned maps using QGIS, as well as how to digitize (trace) features from this scanned map to create new shapefiles. In addition, the module will introduce students to basic methods of geocoding locations from addresses. These are two key ways of creating spatial data from printed sources, as well as from text fields.

**3. Satellite Imagery**
February 15, 11am-1pm  
Exercise due February 22  
This module will cover methods for obtaining high resolution satellite imagery (via the Google Static Maps API) as well as low resolution satellite imagery from the Landsat Program. The workshop and exercise will cover the difference between these two types of remotely sensed data as well as methods for creating false color composites and simple land classification schemes.

**4. Web Mapping 01**  
February 22, 11am-1pm   
Exercise due March 1  
In this two part module will introduce webmaps using Mapbox GL JS. This tutorial will introduce basic setup for making a webmap including basic elements of development for a web browser. 

**5. Web Mapping 02**
March 1, 11am-1pm  
Exercise due March 8  
In part two of the web mapping module students will learn how to create custom basemaps (tilesets) using external data. Students will be introduced to methods for creating custom tilesets with vector as well as raster data (satellite imagery).


**6.Final Project Publishing**
**Required for all students**
March 8, 11am-1pm  
Exercise due March 15  
In this required module students will learn how to compose a document using markdown, a very simple markup language, and how to publish this document as a webpage using Jekyll and github pages. All students are required to attend this session and to use this format for the submission of their final projects.
